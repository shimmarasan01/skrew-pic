# SkrewPic

<p align="justify">SkrewPic, the project that I worked on as a part of my "Mini Project" subject at <a href="https://qiu.edu.my/">QIU</a>. My supervisor and moderator criticised the underwhelming performance of the image classification model. This project was my first dive into developing Android apps using Java and machine learning.</p>

<p align="justify">A short walkthrough on how users can snap/pick pictures of screws, bolts, and nuts from their camera/gallery and find out the exact type and uses of it.</p>

## 🔍 Features

<p align="justify">An Android application that leverages image classification technology, with its own set of unique features.</p>

### 🎨 **Minimalistic UI/UX**
<p align="justify">Focusing on simplicity and functionality, with large buttons, a clean color scheme of light blue and white, and a lack of unnecessary animations. It ensures a streamlined and user-friendly experience.</p>

### 🧠 **TensorFlow Model** 
<p align="justify">Lightweight TensorFlow model (.tflite format), developed with Python. This model classifies a fastener from an image fed into it. It guarantees a quick (very) and precise (sometimes) result providing users with information about the type and uses of the particular fastener.</p>

### 💾 **SQLite Database** 
<p align="justify">Storing information such as names, types, descriptions, and uses of screws, bolts, and nuts. The database also keeps classification histories, ensuring users can review their previous classifications. The use of SQLite allows seamless data management, even when offline.</p>
